# Vize â€“ Voice Based Interface for Data Visualization and Summarization

### About the Project
This project aims to develop a web-based tool that leverages speech recognition to make data exploration and visualization accessible to everyone. By using simple voice commands, users can easily upload their data, create various visualizations (like charts and graphs), and even request summaries of their data. A unique feature of this tool is its Data Visualization Recommendation System (DVRS), which automatically suggests relevant visualizations based on the data, making it easier for users to gain insights from their data. This tool is particularly beneficial for users with visual impairments or those who prefer a hands-free experience.

### Tools Used
**Front-end:** React, Redux, Materials UI, Ant Library \
**Back-end:** Django \
**Database**: SQL \
**DVRS:** Sequential Neural Network
